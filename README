== OpaCms ==

Author Matthieu Guffroy

build : make
launch : ./opacms.exe (port 8080)
         ./opacms.exe --server-port nnnn (port nnnn)

The editor : 
The wysiwyg editor is TinyMCE.
It's done using some bypass

Edit page :
goto /user or /admin
login with admin:admin
go back to the / page
you can edit the page and create new one

DEMO :
A demo is here 
=> http://opacmsdemo.mattgu.com


=== TUTO APACHE ===

== 1. Use a subdomain ==
This my example config file for opacmsdemo.mattgu.com :

<VirtualHost *:80>
	ServerName   opacmsdemo.mattgu.com:80
	ProxyPass / http://127.0.0.1:8080/
	ProxyPassReverse / http://127.0.0.1:8080/
	ProxyPreserveHost on
	ProxyRequests On
	ProxyVia On

	<Proxy *>
		Order allow,deny
		Allow from all
	</Proxy>
</VirtualHost>


==2. Use an alias ==
If you want to get an alias (example: www.mysite.com/opacms)
You must have :

ProxyPass /opacms http://localhost:8080/opacms
ProxyPassReverse /opacms http://localhost:8080/opacms
ProxyPreserveHost on
ProxyVia On

The Two first line are indeed very usefull,
the ProxyPreserveHost is also really import for OPA. If not you could have some problem.
I don't know if the ProxyVia is important you could try without.
Then you need to launch your server with the option (--base-url opacms).

==== Solution with nginx ====

Here is my nginx file, for the demo :

server {
  server_name opacmsdemo.mattgu.com;

  location / {
    proxy_set_header  Host                opacmsdemo.mattgu.com;
    proxy_set_header  X-Real-IP           $remote_addr;
    proxy_set_header  X-Forwarded-For     $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    proxy_pass                            http://10.0.0.106;
  }
}

http://10.0.0.106 is where is launched your application.
It could be somthing like : http://localhost:8080
