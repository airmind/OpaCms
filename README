== OpaCms ==

Author Matthieu Guffroy

build : make
launch : ./opacms.exe (port 8080)
         ./opacms.exe --server-port nnnn (port nnnn)

The editor : 
This project use a javascript bypass, and the editor is nicEdit.
Warning, don't use it for a public input, javascript injection (xss fail)
is possible. Maybe in a future release I would patch it.

The user-connection :
In the main.opa you could see a variable admin : {false} / {true : string}
If the variable is {false} you can't edit, and if the variable is {true=someuser} you can edit the page, create page etc...

The main present in the depot use my opaCas module, and it is configured to use the UTC CAS (my school). To login you must access to the url
http://localhost:8080/CAS/login

opaCas folder must be in the same folder than OpaCms folder.
