== OpaCms ==

Author Matthieu Guffroy

build : make
launch : ./opacms.exe (port 8080)
         ./opacms.exe --server-port nnnn (port nnnn)

The editor : 
Now the wysiwyg editor is TinyMCE.

Edit page :
goto /user or /admin
login with admin/admin
go back to the / page
you can edit the page and create new one

WARNING :
The opacms is functionnal with GoogleChrome, normally it must be compatible with all navigator.
Please let me informed if you experience problems with one navigator...

Bug knonw :
* With firefox, the page does'nt refresh, when you edit it or when some admin modify it...
You must refresh it manually, it's not critical.... But it make me unhappy :(

DEMO :
A demo is here 
=> http://opacmsdemo.mattgu.com


=== TUTO APACHE ===

== 1. Use a subdomain ==
This my example config file for opacmsdemo.mattgu.com :

<VirtualHost 62.193.245.98:80>
	ServerName   opacmsdemo.mattgu.com:80
	ProxyPass / http://127.0.0.1:8080/
	ProxyPassReverse / http://127.0.0.1:8080/
	ProxyPreserveHost on
	ProxyRequests On
	ProxyVia On

	<Proxy *>
		Order allow,deny
		Allow from all
	</Proxy>
</VirtualHost>


==2. Use an alias ==
If you want to get an alias (example: www.mysite.com/opacms)
You must have :

ProxyPass /opacms http://localhost:8080/opacms
ProxyPassReverse /opacms http://localhost:8080/opacms
ProxyPreserveHost on
ProxyVia On

The Two first line are indeed very usefull,
the ProxyPreserveHost is also really import for OPA. If not you could have some problem.
I don't know if the ProxyVia is important you could try without.
Then you need to launch your server with the option (--base-url opacms).
WARNING: This option is really new in opa, then get the last version of OPA, and then keep in mind it is experimental...
